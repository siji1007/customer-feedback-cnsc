This development focuses on the development of a digital feedback system with
the implementation of a topic modeling at Camarines Norte State College (CNSC),
aiming to enhance client satisfaction by streamlining feedback collection, analysis, and
interpretation. The scope encompasses the design and development of the web-based
system, data collection, and preprocessing from feedback sources, implementation of
the BERTopic modeling algorithm, feedback analysis and reporting, and system
evaluation through user surveys and feedback. The Office of the Vice President for
Research and Extension(OVPRE) serves as the primary administrator of the system,
and Delivery Unit Heads will view aggregated results specific to their department, while
students, employees, and other stakeholders are engaged as feedback users.
Delimitations of this development include its specific application to CNSC, which
may limit the applicability of findings to organizations with different structures or cultural
contexts. The development will not employ other machine learning techniques such as
classification, clustering (other than topic modeling), or regression. Moreover, the
results might not be fully generalizable outside the educational sector due to CNSC's
unique characteristics.
